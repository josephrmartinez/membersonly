- Start with a sign-up form so you can get some users into your DB! Don’t forget to sanitize and validate the form fields and secure the passwords with bcrypt. You should add a confirmPassword field to your sign-up form and then validate it using a custom validator. 

- When users sign up, they should not be automatically given membership status! What fun is a private club if just anyone can join? Add a page where members can “join the club” by entering a secret passcode. If they enter the passcode correctly then update their membership status.
